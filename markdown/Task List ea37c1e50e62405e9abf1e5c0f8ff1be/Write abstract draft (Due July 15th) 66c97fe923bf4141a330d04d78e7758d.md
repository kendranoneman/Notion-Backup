1. Topic 
    - MT population activity in response to brief motion pulses
2. Title 
    - Key words: vision, eye movements, area MT, motion pulses, populations of neurons, dimensionality reduction, non-human primates, trajectories, saccades, smooth pursuit, fixation
    - Brainstorming:
        1. Investigating the trajectories of MT population activity in response to brief motion pulses
3. Introduction (~1-2 sentences)
    - Motivation
        1. Neural responses in MT are correlated with the perception of motion
        2. Fixation vs pursuit
        3. "MT neurons are velocity selective, each responds best to a preferred velocity (speed and direction) within its receptive field"
        4. Visual responses of MT determined by properties of stimulus (retinal position, direction of motion, speed of motion)
        
        visual responses of MT neurons are determined principally by five properties of the
        stimulus
        
    - Problem statement
4. Methods/approach (~1 sentence)
    - Single-unit electrode recording, non-human primates, dimensionality reduction techniques
5. Results (~2-4 sentences)
6. Conclusions/takeaway (~1-2 sentences) 

**Draft 1:**

The medial temporal area (MT), a sensory response area of the primate visual cortex, plays a large role in visual motion processing and has proven to be a rich site for direction- and speed-sensitive neurons. Previous work has shown... In this work, we are interested in the responses of MT population activity to brief motion pulses during periods of fixation and pursuit. Our central question: do motion pulses, of varying speeds, push population activity along the same trajectory as eye movements or orthogonally to eye movements? To find this intrinsic dimension, we employ dimensionality reduction techniques to transform high-dimensional single-unit recordings into lower-dimensional space. Our expected results... Conclusion... 

**Draft 2:**

Natural vision involves unexpected moving objects, self-induced motion, and expectations about motion in the world. The medial temporal area (MT), a sensory response area of the primate visual cortex, plays a critical role in visual motion processing and consists of direction- and speed-sensitive neurons. MT responses are typically thought to be "purely" sensory, driven by the presented stimulus, alongside cognitive modulations (for example, in the form of attention). The sensory and cognitive aspects of the neuronal mechanisms involved in rapid sensory-motor transformations, such as smooth pursuit eye movements, are unclear. One possibility is that the reflex-like oculomotor response to motion onset observed during pursuit is too rapid to engage cognitive mechanisms. To test this general idea, we analyzed the responses of small populations of neurons in macaque area MT to brief motion pulses (50 ms duration) during periods of fixation and pursuit. We asked if motion pulses of varying speeds drive population activity along a similar trajectory as eye movements or orthogonally to eye movements. To find this intrinsic dimension, we employed dimensionality reduction techniques to transform high-dimensional spiking data, recorded using linear multi-contact electrode arrays, into lower-dimensional space. Overall, this work addresses fundamental questions about the interaction of sensory processing and cognition at the level of populations in area MT, useful for understanding the neural mechanisms of motion perception in the natural world.

**Draft 3:**

Natural vision involves unexpected moving objects, self-induced motion, and expectations about changes in the world. The medial temporal area (MT), a sensory response area of the primate visual cortex, plays a critical role in visual motion processing and consists of direction- and speed-sensitive neurons. MT responses are often thought to be ‚Äúpurely‚Äù sensory, driven by the presented stimulus, in addition to cognitively modulated (for example, by visual attention). The sensory and cognitive aspects of the neuronal mechanisms involved in sensory-motor transformations, such as smooth pursuit eye movements, are unclear. One possibility is that the reflex-like, oculomotor response to motion onset observed during pursuit is rapid enough to mitigate the effects of cognitive mechanisms. Alternatively, extrasensory XXX unrelated to stimulus identity may be an integral and unavoidable part of behavior. To test these ideas, we recorded from small populations of neurons in macaque area MT using linear multi-contact electrode arrays and analyzed neuronal responses to brief motion pulses(50 ms duration)during periods of fixation and pursuit. We asked if motion pulses of various speeds (i.e., sensory input) drive population activity along a similar trajectory as eye movements (i.e., motor or reafferent input). To find the relevant dimensions for understanding the data, we employed dimensionality reduction techniques to transform the high-dimensional (~20-D) spiking data into lower-dimensional space. Our overarching goal is to delineate the sometimes subtle differences in sensory processing and cognition that are at times not readily apparent at the level of individual neurons by using simultaneously recorded populations of MT neurons to better understand the neural mechanisms of motion perception in the natural world.
