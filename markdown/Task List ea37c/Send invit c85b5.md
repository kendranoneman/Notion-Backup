Dear Dr. Sussillo,

On behalf of the graduate students of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, I am very pleased to invite you to give a talk for the CNBC Colloquium Series for the 2021-2022 academic year. The speakers in this series were selected by the students and post-docs of the CNBC, so there is considerable interest here for your work.

It was a few years ago, but we've actually chatted one-on-one over skype before. I was a sophomore undergraduate interested in computational neuroscience and you gave me some advice on how to break into this field; specifically you advised me to take a bunch of math, which I did. Four years later, after utilizing your tips, I am a 2nd year PhD student at CMU in Neural Computation analyzing high-dimensional neural data recorded from area MT of macaques. 

The 2021-2022 CNBC Colloquium Series will be held over Zoom. A ‚Äúvirtual visit‚Äù to Pittsburgh will be over 1-2 days, where you will get a chance to meet with faculty and students in the CNBC and give a one hour talk on your current work or research.

If you accept this invitation, Emily Bandi, Assistant to CNBC Co-Director Barb Shinn-Cunningham, will contact you to arrange a convenient date for your talk. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.

We hope to hear from you soon!

Best Regards,
