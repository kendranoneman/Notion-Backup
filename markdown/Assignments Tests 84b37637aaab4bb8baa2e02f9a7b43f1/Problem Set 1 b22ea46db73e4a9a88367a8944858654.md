    "Though Kandinsky is widely credited with inventing abstract painting, art history has generally sided with Malevich, whose “Black Square” threw down the gauntlet for nonobjective painting in 1915. That work (which is not on view) provoked Kandinsky to produce the flip response “In the Black Square,” which he painted in 1923."
